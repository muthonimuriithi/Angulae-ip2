# Gitsearch Repos

This is an Angular app that uses github API to access user data from github. Once you submit the user name
it retrives the users details and repositories from github.  

##### By Loise Muthoni


### Requirements

* An access to the internet.

* Either a computer,phone,tablet or an Ipad


## Technologies used
*  Angular CLI version 7.1.4.

* Both HTml and css 

* Bootstrap

## Intallation

* Git lone this repository to a location in your file system.

* Open terminal command line then navigate to the root folder of the application.

* Run ng serve command.

* Navigate to http://localhost:4200/ in your browser.

# Behavior Driven Development

1. On the nav bar navigate to the profile section. This provides you a form to search for users name and will output
their repositories.

2. On the nav bar you navigate to the repositories button. This wiil allow you to search for other repositories
on github.

## Development

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
